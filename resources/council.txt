Silverblade leadership operates as a council, there is no guild master (although the rank has to be held by someone, so it often rotates around people). The current council consists of:

${wow_api.fetch_ranks_with_class_icons(0,1)}

Please contact any of them if you have any enquiries or need more information about them or their roles in the guild.

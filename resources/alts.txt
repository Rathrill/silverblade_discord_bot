We expect you to turn up to raids with you main character in your main spec by default. In some cases, such as when a boss calls for a specific comp, we may discuss asking you to go off-spec or even to an alt.

While it is not required to roll offspecs or alts and getting them ready for raiding, doing so will result in a lot of appreciation, higher priority when it becomes time to hand out off-spec items (which may also help outside the raid), and of course personal loot upgrades will go to an alt.

We will not invite your alt just because you feel like playing it on that particular day. You must provide a good reason why it will make it easier to defeat the boss using the alt.

This is primarily because of forced personal loot, because we don't want items spreading across many characters being played by one person. We prefer more loot to go to one character for improved output, leading to improved progress.

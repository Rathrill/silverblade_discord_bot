We expect you to have read the strategies posted on Discord before the raid. Be ready to deal with any special assignment you may get as a result of your role on the given fight.

Maintain your knowledge of the game and your spec especially. This means a combination of continuous play and practice in various modes of play (M+, lower difficulty raids, PvP, etc.), and using class resources and guides, such as the Discord for your class or continuously updated guides found across the web.

We do not merely expect you to use one of these tools, but to use several in combination to form a strong understand of the class and spec you play.

Furthermore, we expect you to be continuously simming your character with Simcraft, Ask Mr. Robot, or a similar tool in order to always know whether or not a particular item is an upgrade.

Upgrade your gear by participating in WoW's many activities outside raiding to upgrade your gear. Frequently the guild will set particular demands on how prepared you must be to enter a raid with the team. Make sure you are familiar with and meet those goals.

Our raid days are **Thursday** 20:30-23:30 and **Sunday** 20:30-23:30 server time every week. Occasionally the raid time may extend for a few more pulls if we feel we're close to a kill, but never past midnight.   

We expect our raiders to be able to attend both days unless signing the calendar to decline on occasional circumstances.

**Important**

Try to be online 15 minutes before raid. Be on no later than the start and be ready to accept summon immediately.

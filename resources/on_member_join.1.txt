Silverblade is a World of Warcraft **mythic** raiding guild, formed in 2016 after a number of casual but dedicated players wanted to spend a few nights per week raiding together. We've been steadily growing our list of cutting edge achievements from Xavius in Emerald Nightmare through to N'Zoth in Ny'alotha, the Waking City.

We're currently getting ready to raid Mythic Castle Nathria with the team.

We raid every **Sunday** and **Thursday** from **20:30** game time for 3 hours. Our members also participate in regular mythic+ runs, arena, rated/casual battlegrounds and heroic raids after the initial progression run.

If raiding with us is something you're interested in, type `!application` and tell us why! We're always happy to read through applications! You can also contact any one of us in-game, and we'll make sure your request is directed to the right people so we can meet!

Please take a look at the `!rules` before applying.

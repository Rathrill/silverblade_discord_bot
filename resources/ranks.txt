There are a few ground rules you must follow in Silverblade depending on your rank.

**Ranks**

```
 Councillor  - Guild leader and Officer rank.leading.
 High Hand   - A non-raiding officer.
 Crusader    - The main raiding rank.
 Avatar      - The alts of Crusaders.
 Initiate    - People who are in the process of becoming a Crusader.
 Sentinel    - Support rank for people who cannot meet our schedule.
 Hand        - The main social rank
```

**Being a social**

Socials of all stripes are very welcome. They're the friends of other socials and raiders. They're here for the social aspect and the community. There are no demands to their skill. There are a few rules on general behaviour in the guild and falling afoul of those will get you removed. See the bottom of the post for details.

**Becoming a Raider**

In order to become a raider, you should submit an application through this site. Alternatively, contact one of the officers in-game, and we can arrange a meeting.

The standard trial process lasts 2 weeks (total of 4 raids). During this time, we want you to demonstrate that you can learn the fights, play your character, and otherwise adhere to all the other rules that apply to raiders. It may extend, however, if uncertainty arises, but usually it won't.
In other words: As a Trial/Initiate consider yourself a raider, but without the perks. After 2 weeks, you'll be promoted assuming you pass and the perks will be yours.

If, in the unlikely event you, or the raid team decide staying as a raider isn't appropriate, we'll offer you a social rank :-)

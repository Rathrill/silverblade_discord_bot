**Preparation**

Have all types of consumables/enchants ready for every fight BEFORE joining the raid. Types of consumables that are available right now:

- Food, the best type and with the correct stat (sometimes provided).
- Flask, of the best type. Flasks are always expected (sometimes provided).
- Potions (combat/utility).
- Weapon Oils/Stones.
- Vantus runes (usually provided).
- Augment runes (not usually required).

Vantus runes may be provided when needed as well as flasks and feasts, but you must still have your own consumables in the case that they are not being provided on occasion. Augment runes aren't typically required unless under very specific circumstances, but it might be useful to have some just in case.

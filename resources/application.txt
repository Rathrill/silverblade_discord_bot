*Thanks for your interest in applying!*

We're going to need some information from you, but make sure you've read the **!rules** first.

Once you've read the rules, please enter each of the commands below, providing links to your character information web pages:

**Please send each command below as a separate direct message to the bot.**

For example, `!armory https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/frostmane/christopher`

```
!armory      <Type the link to your armory profile>
!raiderio    <Type the link to your raider.io profile>
!logs        <Type the link to your best logs>
```

It would be great if you could also tell us a bit more about you by filling in the required information.
```
!why         <Type why do you want to join? What makes us the guild for you? What do you expect from us?>
!xp          <Type what raiding experience you have so far?>
```

Once you've provided all of this tell me you're `!done`, I'll have someone from our recruitment team get back to you really soon! :-)
